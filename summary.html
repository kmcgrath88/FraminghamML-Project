        <h2>Data Processing</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The initial data was obtained as a .csv file with 11,627 rows of data from 4,434 subjects. Each row contains
            risk factor and event data for a single subject from a given examination period. Each subject has between 1
            - 3
            examination periods (roughly 2 years between each examination period for a given subject). For these
            analyses we
            focused on period #1 (baseline) as it had the most data (4,434 subjects vs. 3,263 subjects in period #3). An
            outcome-specific data file was generated for each outcome, in which the subjects with the relevant prevelant
            disease condition were filtered out (e.g. for the stroke classifier each subject who had already had a
            stroke
            prior to their period 1 examination (PREVSTRK = 1) were filtered out of the data set). In addition, any rows
            with missing values were removed from the outcome-specific data file prior to running classifiers.
        </p>
        <h4>Machine Learning Exploration</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Python's scikit-learn was used to run predictive analyses for each outcome across 4 different machine
            learning
            algorithms: logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and support vector machine. The
            performance
            of
            each algorithm was assessed according to predicted and actual outcomes and the following testing metrics:
            accuracy,
            precision, recall, and f1-measure.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Findings</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We found that the class imbalance in a predicted outcome significantly affected which testing metric
            accurately
            measured the performance of machine learning algorithm. For outcomes with highly imbalanced classes (e.g.
            MI_CHD: negative event = , positive event = ) using test accuracy is a very misleading metric, as the number
            of correctly called negatives far outweighs the small percentage of correctly called positives. A better test
            metric then, is the f1- measure, which is the harmonic mean of the precision and recall. We also found that support 
            vector machines (SVMs) seemed to perform better than the other machine learning algorithms, especially for outcomes 
            with imbalanced classes. SVMs tended to have the highest F1-measure for each outcome and generally predicted a greater 
            number of true positives than the other algorithms.</p>
